# üé§ MeetMute

A Chrome extension that allows you to quickly mute/unmute your microphone in Google Meet using a customizable keyboard shortcut.

## Features

- **Quick Toggle**: Mute/unmute your microphone instantly with a keyboard shortcut
- **Global Shortcut**: Works from any Chrome tab or window (default: `Ctrl+Shift+M` / `Cmd+Shift+M`)
- **Three-State Dynamic Icon**: Professional microphone icon that shows current status:
  - üü¢ **Green microphone**: Traditional mic design (Meet tab open, unmuted)
  - üî¥ **Red microphone with slash**: Same mic with diagonal line (Meet tab open, muted)
  - ‚ö´ **Grey microphone**: Inactive state (no Google Meet tabs open)
- **Smart Detection**: Automatically finds and targets active Google Meet tabs
- **Safety First**: Only targets your personal microphone button, never host/moderator controls
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows mute status notifications + icon changes
- **Auto-Sync**: Icon automatically updates when you manually toggle mute in Google Meet
- **Configurable**: Easy-to-use popup interface with status information

## Installation

### Method 1: Load as Developer Extension

1. **Download or Clone** this repository to your computer
2. **Load Extension**:
   - Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select the MeetMute folder
   - The extension should load with proper icons (green/red microphone)
3. **Configure Shortcut** (optional):
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`
   - Find "MeetMute" and set your preferred keyboard shortcut
   - Default is `Ctrl+Shift+M` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+M` (Mac)

### Method 2: Chrome Web Store (Coming Soon)
The extension will be available on the Chrome Web Store once published.

## Usage

### Basic Usage
1. Join a Google Meet call
2. Press your configured keyboard shortcut (default: `Ctrl+Shift+M` or `Cmd+Shift+M`)
3. Your microphone will toggle between muted and unmuted states
4. A brief notification will show the current status

### Extension Popup
Click the MeetMute icon in Chrome's toolbar to:
- View current keyboard shortcut
- Check extension status
- Test the mute functionality
- Access shortcut configuration

## How It Works

The extension consists of several components:

1. **Background Script**: Listens for keyboard shortcuts and manages tab communication
2. **Content Script**: Injected into Google Meet pages to interact with the mute button
3. **Popup Interface**: Provides status information and configuration options

### Keyboard Shortcut Behavior
- Works when Chrome is the active application
- Automatically finds Google Meet tabs
- If multiple Meet tabs are open, prioritizes the currently active tab
- Provides visual feedback through notifications

### Compatibility
- **Supported**: Google Meet (meet.google.com)
- **Browser**: Chrome (Manifest V3)
- **OS**: Windows, macOS, Linux

## Limitations

- **Chrome Only**: Shortcuts work only when Chrome is the active application (Chrome extension limitation)
- **Google Meet Only**: Currently supports Google Meet only
- **Tab Detection**: Requires Google Meet to be open in a Chrome tab

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working
- **Check Status**: Open the extension popup to see if Meet tabs are detected
- **Reload Extension**: Go to `chrome://extensions/` and reload MeetMute
- **Refresh Meet Tab**: Reload your Google Meet tab
- **Check Shortcut**: Verify keyboard shortcut is configured at `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`

### Shortcut Not Responding
- **Chrome Focus**: Ensure Chrome is the active application
- **Conflicting Shortcuts**: Check if another app is using the same shortcut
- **Meet Tab Active**: Make sure you're in an active Google Meet call
- **Extension Permissions**: Verify the extension has access to the Meet tab

### Multiple Meet Tabs
- The extension will prioritize the currently active Meet tab
- If no tab is active, it will use the first available Meet tab

### Extension Muting Everyone (Critical Issue Fixed)
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Issue**: Previous versions could accidentally click "mute all" host controls
- **‚úÖ Fixed**: Extension now has strict safety checks to prevent this
- **Safety Features**: Only targets personal microphone button in main toolbar
- **Never Targets**: Host controls, participant lists, or admin buttons
- **Console Logs**: Check browser console (F12) for "MeetMute:" safety messages
- **Update Required**: Reload extension in `chrome://extensions/` to get the fix

### ~~Toolbar Icon Not Changing~~ ‚úÖ FIXED in v1.2.0!
- **Previous Issue**: Icon only changed when you were on the Meet tab
- **Solution**: v1.2.0+ uses smart toggle logic that immediately updates the icon
- **How It Works**: 
  - Extension assumes toggle worked and flips icon instantly
  - Periodic state sync (every 5 seconds) corrects any drift when on Meet tabs
  - No more waiting for UI updates that don't happen on inactive tabs
- **Result**: Icon updates are now instant and reliable from any tab! üéâ

### If Icons Still Don't Update (Rare)
- **Manual Sync**: Click "Sync Icon State" button in extension popup
- **Reload Extension**: Go to `chrome://extensions/` and reload MeetMute
- **Check Notifications**: Extension shows "Microphone Muted/Unmuted" status messages

## Privacy & Security

- **No Data Collection**: The extension does not collect or store any personal data
- **Local Operation**: All functionality works locally within your browser
- **Minimal Permissions**: Only requests necessary permissions for Google Meet interaction
- **Open Source**: Code is available for review and audit
